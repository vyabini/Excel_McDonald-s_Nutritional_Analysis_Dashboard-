 McDonald's Nutritional Analysis Dashboard Documentation
Objective: 
In today's health-conscious world, there is a growing emphasis on maintaining a balance between enjoying delicious food and sticking to healthy eating habits. The primary goal of this project is to provide McDonald's customers with a transparent view of the nutritional composition of menu items. By doing so, we empower them to make choices that align with their health and dietary preferences while still enjoying their favourite McDonald's offerings.

Approach:
1. Dynamic Calorie Chart:
Developed a dynamic calorie chart that displays the nutritional values for each selected menu item.
Introduced an ideal intake index to guide customers in ordering menu items within their desired calorie intake.
Implemented in Excel using a dependent list of categories and menu items using the Indirect function.
2. Sugar Content Control:
Focused on quantifying the sugar content in desserts to help customers in managing their sugar intake effectively.
3. Meal Planning:
Recognized the importance of balanced meals, assuming four meals a day with an ideal daily calorie intake of 2000 calories.
Identified menu items suitable for a single meal without the need for additional combinations.
Utilized Excel's pivot tables and slicers to filter and list items based on calorie content below 500 calories for a single meal.
4. Fat Percentage Analysis:
Calculated the percentage of fat content relative to the total calorie content of each menu item.
Highlighted items with more than 50% fat content in their calorie composition.
Categorized items by their respective categories.
Achieved using Excel's pivot tables, unique, and filter functions, combined with radio buttons, IFS, and filter functions for category-specific item retrieval.
5. Fat vs. Calorie Relationship:
Explored the relationship between total calorie content and calories from fat in each menu item.
6. Micronutrient Richness:
Introduced a new attribute to showcase which micronutrient (Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Calcium, Iron) a menu item is particularly rich in compared to others.
Facilitated the classification of items with varying micronutrient profiles within each category.
7. Top Carbohydrate Items:
Dynamically displayed the top N items with the highest carbohydrate content.
Implemented this feature in Excel using functions such as Filter, Large, Sort, and IF conditions to ensure user-defined values for N are logical and within the range of available data.

Recommendations:
1. Menu Optimization for Nutritional Balance:
McDonaldâ€™s can consider adjusting the serving sizes of menu items to align more closely with the Ideal Intake Index. This strategic move would ensure that the nutrient composition of their offerings falls within the recommended limits, reducing wastage and promoting healthier eating habits among customers.
2. Health Promotion Campaigns:
McDonald's should embark on media campaigns that emphasize the importance of health without compromising the beloved flavours of their food items. These campaigns can encourage customers to make informed choices while highlighting the deliciousness of their menu items.
3. Enhanced Nutritional Transparency:
Elevate the brand's credibility by enhancing the transparency of ingredients and providing accurate nutritional compositions for each menu item. This not only builds trust among customers but also empowers them to make well-informed dietary decisions. Clear and accessible nutritional information can be prominently displayed on packaging, websites, and in-store materials.
